# TssPrediction
Evaluation of middle-range promoter context, and prediction of TSS 
PRI200_60-750_450_arabiAll.txt, PRI200_60-750_450_riceAll.txt, and FUI_riceAll.txt are finalized PRI and FUI scores for Arabidopsis and rice.
Arabidopsis scores can be applied for brassicaseae, and rice scores for poaseae, so no new score tables are necessary.
For the other plant families and animals, family-specific PRI tables should be prepared based on their genomes.
